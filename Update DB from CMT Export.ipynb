This script tries to handle updates made in CMT and synchronize them across the local data base. It would be a lot easier to do this if we had access to the unique reviewer key stored in CMT (then we could use that as a primary key) but we don't seem to have access to that. In fact it was only very late on that I thought about it, and I haven't asked CMT if we can 'see' it."
